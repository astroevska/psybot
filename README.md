# Telegram Psychological Bot
A [Telegram](https://telegram.org) bot based on [aiogram](https://github.com/aiogram/aiogram) and [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) with cloud-based NoSQL-database [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) implemented through [pymongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver) package. The solution has REST API service and is based on asynchronous patterns. Also, the bot is written with static typing for self-checking and improving the readability of the code.

## Features
- üìù **Passing tests**
- ‚è∞ **Reminders** (bot can remind you to pass a test by your self-defined time)
- üìä **Statistics of your results**
- üåç **EN/UA/RU** multilanguage supporting
- üì° **Full-provided REST API**

## Details
The main mission of the bot - helping people (especially developers) to prevent burnout and depression. The bot allows:
- passing the evidence based psychological assessments (currently, only **The Beck Depression Inventory Test** `BDI-II`) with a user-friendly interface based on the Telegram inline keyboard.
- viewing dynamics changes (by plots implemented by [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) and [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn)) of a user's mental condition (time-series of tests results) to control it and notice patterns.
- getting human-readable interpretations of tests result for a better understanding own mental condition.

## Requirements
1. Python3.9 or newer.
2. [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
3. [MongoDB Atlas](https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-atlas-cli)

## Installation
I created a Bash script that provides a simple and quick initialization of the bot. The script creates and activates a virtual environment, installs packages from `requirements.txt`, replaces constants with private access tokens for **Telegram Bot API** and **MongoDB**, and starts the bot. 

**The only thing you need is to run an `init.sh` file by the following command in your CLI:**
```
$ git clone https://github.com/annagerd/psybot.git
$ cd psybot
$ ./init.sh YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN YOUR_MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
```
1. `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is a **Telegram Bot Access Token**. There is a getting token [here](https://t.me/BotFather) through creating a new Telegram bot.
2. `YOUR_MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` is a connection string for **MongoDB** that is accessible after the MongoDB Cluster creation. [See details](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/connection-string).

## Goals
- Deployment (Heroku, Vercel or DigitalOcean).
- Dockerize the bot (to facilitate deployment).
- Add more tests (depression, anxiety, burnout and etc).
- Start to create an IT ecosystem of psychological self-care with the bot as a part of it.
